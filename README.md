# ColorPalette App

The NavigationGraph3 project introduces the idea of Theming and branding an app, and refers to this app.

As my main app is an automotive app, I looked for ideas for different themes based on automotive images. The images then help in the design of a colour scheme. A very useful tool to help extract colours from an image is available using Googleâ€™s androidx.palette.graphics via Xamarin.AndroidX.Palette. The ColorPalette app allows you to add images you have obtained and then extracts colour swatches from the image. 

Build and run it substituting your webp images to get a starting point for your colour scheme.
