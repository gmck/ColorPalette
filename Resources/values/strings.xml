		The Palette library was very useful some years ago when I built one of my first apps. It is valuable if you start out designing a new theme for an app if you are inclined to base a brand and a colour theme from an attractive image. You may even be considering offering several colour themes, supporting both Light and Dark themes for the app.
		\n\nThe library allows you to extract colours from an image. It does this by generating 6 different Palette.Swatches. The swatches are VibrantSwatch, DarkVibrantSwatch, LightVibrantSwatch, MutedSwatch, DarkMutedSwatch, LightMutedSwatch. To be continued in Readme of the project...
